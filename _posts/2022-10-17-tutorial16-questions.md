What is the total dose deposited to the ionization chamber cavity? 

Why is this different from the total dose to air?

The total dose to the air cavity is the sum of the dose to regions 3, 7 and 31: 6.6491 × 10−15 ± 1.002%.

This is smaller than the total dose to air under Summary of media dosimetry, 
which includes the dose to air regions outside the chamber.

1% of hernias repaired with the Shouldice method fail again. 

Cut 1) cut with scalpel from a) a spot 2cm inferio-medial to the anterior superior iliac spine to b) the pubic tubercle; cut parallel to the inguinal ligament. 
Look inside the cut, can you see the inguinal canal? can you see the femoral space? 

Cut 2: cut deeper (Dissection is deepened): 

Look inside this cut ; can you see the external oblique fascia? can you see the superficial inguinal ring?
can you see the ilio-inguinal nerve? can you see the ilio-hypogastric nerve?   tip: The nerves run deep to the external oblique, superior to the deep ring and superficial to the cord structures.

Manouver: Isolate the spermatic cord , View the posterior floor, in particular the medial aspect.
longitudinal anterior opening in the cremasteric muscle fibers at the midpoint of the canal extended medially to the pubic tubercle, creating two flaps of muscle medial and lateral to the cord [Figure 1]. 

Do you see a lipoma ? if yes then ; cut from the cord towards the internal ring and remove it. 
why do that? it is easier to see the indirect sac in its normal position (antero-medial). 

Indirect sac present? 
Isolate the indirect sac from the cord and internal ring 
cut it out (excised). 
The stump should retract naturally into the peritoneal cavity. 
Some surgeons only reduce the sac to avoid peritoneal irritation and discomfort. 
Something to look out for ;  if the sac is thicker, contains more fat than usual or is broad based, it might be a sliding hernia. 
If it is sliding hernia , then these are  are reduced and not opened. 

If a sac is not identified, the dissection of the cord at the internal ring must identify a peritoneal protrusion, which can be aided by gentle traction on the cord. 
The identification of this structure, which is in its normal anatomic position, assures the surgeon that the indirect hernia has not been missed. 
After complete dissection of the cord, both flaps of the cremasteric muscle are divided sharply and ligated. 
These stumps are used to support the repair at a later point in the procedure.

The posterior wall of the inguinal canal is examined for a direct hernia then opened beginning at the internal ring in parallel to the internal oblique muscle fibers. 
Care should be taken not to injure the inferior epigastric vessels found medial to the internal ring. 

The lateral flap should be wide enough, at least 1 cm, to reach the edge of the rectus sheath in the first layer of the repair. 

Any redundant transversalis fascia of a direct hernia should be excised. 

Preperitoneal examination of the internal oblique muscle and fascia cephalad to the internal ring and the inguinal canal, should confirm the presence of an interstitial hernia. 

If present, the internal ring can be incised laterally to include an interstitial defect. 

The internal ring would then be displaced laterally after reconstruction. 

Dissection below the inguinal ligament should identify Cooper's ligament and thus confirm the presence or absence of a femoral hernia [Figure 2A]. 

The superficial thigh fascia or cribiformis fascia caudal to the inguinal ligament should be incised to examine the femoral space from below [Figure 2B]. In addition, this mobilizes the inguinal ligament and external oblique for use in the reconstruction.

A continuous repair with 32–34 gauge stainless steel wire is used for the reconstruction. 
This may be substituted with a 3–0 polypropylene suture. 
It is a four-layer tissue reconstruction using two separate sutures. 
A continuous technique distributes the strength of the repair evenly and should be without tension. 
A relaxing incision is rarely required.

The first two layers represent an overlapped reconstruction. 

It begins medially, anchoring over the pubic tubercle, 
leaving a sufficient end to tie the returning suture after the second layer. 
The inferolateral flap of transversalis fascia is sutured to the lateral edge of the rectus sheath by 
reaching underneath the superior-medial flap [Figure 3A]. 

The reconstruction then moves laterally to the aponeurosis of the transversus abdominis and the edge of the internal oblique muscle. 

The lateral extent of this layer redefines the internal ring and should include the superior stump of the divided lateral flap of cremasteric muscle [Figure 3B]. 

This buttresses the internal ring and helps prevent an indirect recurrence. 

The suturing is then reversed to begin the second layer. 

The superior flap of transversalis fascia is sutured to the shelving portion of the inguinal ligament then tied at the pubic tubercle [Figure 4]. 

The periosteum should not be included in any bite as this can result in a painful osteitis.

Figure 3
Reconstruction: the first layer. A) Starting at the pubic tubercle, the lateral flap of transversalis fascia is taken to the edge of rectus sheath underneath the medial flap; 
and B) The layer is completed with the reconstruction of internal ring. The lateral stump of cremasteric muscle is taken with the bite of transversalis to buttress its medial edge of the new internal ring, prior to emerging with a full thickness bite of internal oblique.

Figure 4
Reconstruction: the second layer Using the same suture, it is continued from the internal ring back, taking the medial flap of transversalis fascia to the shelving portion of the inguinal ligament. Overlapping layers are created.

The next stage of reconstruction creates a two-layered imbrication to provide reinforcement. 

The layer is begun superior and slightly lateral to deep ring, anchoring the suture to the internal oblique fascia. 

The inferior flap of the external oblique, millimeters above and parallel to the inguinal ligament, is tacked to the edge of the internal oblique and transversus muscles [Figure 5]. 

In addition, only a small bite of the internal oblique is required, no more than 5 mm. 

Excessively large bites will create tension. At the pubic tubercle, the direction is reversed for the fourth layer and taken back to the internal ring and affixed [Figure 6]. 

The importance of mobilizing the inferior flap of external oblique by previously incising the superficial thigh fascia is realized here. 

The additional mobility allows the external oblique to be used in the third and fourth layers to cover the medial portion of the repair that is susceptible to recurrence. 

The inguinal canal is reconstructed by re-approximating the remaining external oblique fascia, 

returning the cord to its anatomical position. 

The inferior stump of the medial flap of cremasteric muscle is included in the first suture medially to stabilize the position of the testes to the abdominal wall and prevent drooping.

Figure 5
Reconstruction: the third layer. Starting at the medial side of the internal ring, the external and internal oblique are used to imbricate the first two layers. Small bites of external oblique are taken just above the inguinal ligament.

Figure 6
Reconstruction: the fourth layer. The second layer of imbrication using the external and internal oblique. The benefit of incising the cribiformis fascia and the mobilization of the lateral flap of external oblique is realized as a small flap of external oblique remains after the four layers. This small flap is used to reconstruct the inguinal canal and restore the natural anatomic position of the cord structures.

After the surgery, to the patient :
first 48 hours: take  oral narcotic analgesia. 
Evening after operation: Walk in the evening
Next day: light exercises
Discharged on day ?: 
after 4 weeks: can lift heavy

Use local anesthesia. 
1 hour before surgery 
inject meperidine and oral diazepam in to muscle. 
procaine hydrochloride is given throughout to an area from 2cm medial and inferior to the anterior superior iliac spine and proceeds to the pubic tubercle. 

Patient is needed to be awake so that:
you can ask them to strain and then find the hernia easier.
you can better judge the right amount of tension to use when sewing muscles together. 

Before cutting open the inguinal canal, numb the two nerves ( ilio-inguinal ; ilio-hypogastric)  
Infiltrate the internal oblique, superior to the canal. 

Before moving the sperm canal 
find the genital-femoral nerve; in the cremasteric muscle, the peritoneum of the indirect sac and the vas deferens.
numb the genital branch of the genital-femoral nerve
Infiltrate the internal ring, posterior floor, cremasteric muscle 
If patient is not sedated enough during the surgery give them midazolam and fentanyl

look for any other hernias (15% of the time more hernias are found) any direct? indirect? any in the interstitial area? is there one in the femoral area?

Step 1: consultation. 
when did it start?  
likely to be a hernia: I have a lump here which aches.  
less likely to be a hernia :  constant pain even when lying down 
Look at and touch the hernia: 
where is it ? left/right side ;  above inguinal ligament = inguinal hernia ; below inguinal ligament = femoral ligament
how big is it ? 
Is patient overweight ?   yes: tell to lose weight. surgery can only go ahead if waste to hip ratio is below x. Send home.
if pain is too much then go ahead.


comment on cut1 ; Trendelenburg's position may be used to reduce intra-abdominal pressure, facilitating the repair.
comment on cut2; Be careful; do not injure them
comments on cut2;  Infiltration of the internal oblique muscle superior to the canal can provide anesthesia for the internal oblique and peritoneum used later in the reconstruction. 
God forbid you do , but if you damage any nerves (at any time) then cut the damaged parts off (resect)
this will cause some permanent numbness in the area for the patient but is better than the pain caused by a damaged nerve (neuropathy postoperatively). 


Anastheia step 1; after the cut2;  Numb at this point (see the anesthesia steps above about before openingn the canal) 

comment on manouver1 : Infiltrate with local anesthetic the larger lateral cremasteric flap, which includes the genital branch
Infiltrate with local anesthetic the internal ring.

Debunking Myths Of A U.S. Monetary Collapse: 10+ Years Later

Feb. 20, 2022 

Fallacies:

The US Dollar will collapse!

The US Dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power! Inflation is scary! (Not really).

Fallacious argument: 

debt and dollar 

"1990 by Larry Burkett in his book The Coming Economic Earthquake"

A major depression is inevitable for America 
because decades of growing debt-financing by consumers, businesses, and state and (especially) federal governments 
have undermined the health of the economy.

Gives the appearance of wealth when in fact there is poverty. 

The enormous private and public debts bring the law of compound interest into play, 

those who live beyond their means will reach the point at which they not only cannot pay off their debts, but they also can’t even pay the interest on them

—or find anyone willing to lend enough to cover the interest!"


The debt in 1990 was $4 trillion. 

32 years later $26 trillion more in debt, and here we still are. What gives? 

Do we have to spend another 32 years listening to the doomsday crowd telling us how we are just ‘kicking the can down the road’ and the day of reckoning is coming? 

Or is it time for those masses to realize they maybe don’t have it all buttoned up and figured out like they thought they did? 

Maybe they need to reconsider their certainty. 

Are you losing sleep over this concern as well?




Read Larry Burkett articles from 10 years ago  ,  his opinion has not changed.. here on Seeking Alpha first. 

Then read the passionate comment section (over 300 each) in those articles to make sure somebody didn’t say what you are about to say back then. 

It can weaken your arguments if your points are rehashing similar points over a decade later, 

with the caveat to, “just wait Tim! You will see soon enough!”


Debunking Myths of a U.S. Monetary Collapse:

The End of America? Not Quite

"The debt level is unsustainable. Eventually, our creditors will cut us off and we will collapse."

"The Fed is printing so much money, you must buy gold and silver."

"The US Dollar will collapse. It’s already lost 90%+ of its purchasing power."

"America is broke. The Day of Reckoning is here."

This is them:

Robert Prechter, of Elliott Wave International (I am not a subscriber), wrote a book called The Socionomic Theory of Finance. 

I would highly recommend you spend the money on the 700+-page book just to read the first 2 chapters. 

In that book, he will blow up many of your preconceived ideas about what affects the market, such as:

Will news, such as a president assassination (1963), crash stocks? (No)

Do rate hikes equal lower stock prices? (No)

Are rising oil prices bearish for stocks? (No)

Are falling oil prices bearish for stocks? (No)

Does GDP determine the trend of the market? (No)

Is war bullish/bearish for stocks? (No) – this one is timely with the Ukraine/Russia drama.

Does inflation make gold and silver go up? (No)

... Plus many more fallacies destroyed

Fallacy #1: 

The US Dollar is About to Collapse. Inflation Makes Us Poorer

Idea: 

the Fed is printing trillions of dollars, 

thus making all your existing dollars’ worth less, 

and there is some point in the future that it will break and go from “worth less” to worthless.

This is usually where the scared prophet whips out an ominous graph showing you how the purchasing power of your money has already collapsed through history. Like this:
see image - Purchasing Power over the Decades- The Collapsing Purchasing Power of the US Dollar (Visual Capitalist)

Bible tells us in Proverbs 18:17: “The first to state his case seems right, until another comes and cross-examines him.”

cross-examine this claim 

baseless 

Let's start our journey with a descriptive quote. Oscar Wilde once wrote:

“A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything, and the value of nothing.”

but what about the price of .. gas, or eggs, or milk, etc. 

as the basis for your argument of why we are going to collapse under the worthless dollar, 

which causes you to be pessimists when it comes to the value of the dollar. 

This pessimism then causes you to react in certain ways that seem logical but are not rooted in reality. 

I have family members who used this exact logic to load up on silver in the '80s, much to their current chagrin. 

As your cross-examiner, I want you to consider this argument to see if you really have lost as much purchasing power as you have been told. 

Let’s take the dollar out of our 'price of things' discussion, which is a stumbling block to many, and instead, 


price everything in something 100% stable that we all have:

Hours of time

1 hour of time for you = 1 hour of time for Elon Musk, 

recently the richest man on the planet. 

He just gets more dollars per hour than you or I do.

From here, let’s look at a few items that are priced in hours of time today, 

compared to hours of time decades ago. 

For sake of the example, let’s use a minimum wage worker since everyone likes to talk about how inflation is hurting the poor.

Let's first start off with the low-hanging fruit. 

Below you see a 20-year price chart of the Reuters/Jefferies CRB (Commodity Index) 

which is a basket of 19 commodities broken down as 

39% Energy, 41% Agriculture, 7% Precious Metals, and 13% Industrial Metals. 

As you can see, it is a pretty good representation of a basket of input costs for many of the items we live with day-to-day.
see image... 20 Year Price Chart - CRB Index - CRB Index (StockCharts.com)

StockCharts.com only goes back 2 decades, but the point can still be made. 

This basket traded at 182.32 on February 2002 and closed today (Feb 18th, 2022) at 263.62. 

In 2002, the federal minimum wage was $5.15 per hour, while today it is $7.25 per hour. 

A minimum wage worker in 2002 would have to spend 35.40 hours of labor to earn 1 unit of this basket of commodities. 

Today, that same minimum wage earner would need to spend 36.36 hours of their labor to acquire the same amount of goods.

Does 2.7% more hours of labor after 20 years 

(and this coming on the back of a 160% increase from the COVID lows) sound like we are being destroyed by inflation? 

Of course, most of us are not in the market for a basket of raw input costs, so let’s look at something most of us do daily... driving.

I have a close friend who is trying to tell me how crazy my ideas are because when he looks at his gasoline bill, his costs are up over 50% Y-O-Y. 

He then wants me to ask the average person if they made twice as much in 2021 as they did in 2020. 

He concludes by saying “very few could answer yes.” He wasn’t done though, he ended his text to me with the typical proof of the convinced by saying, 

“Since 1971, money printing has gone crazy, and we have lost 90%+ of our dollars' purchasing power. The curse of inflation is staring us in the face.” 

Now there’s an original argument.

My friend’s argument, like many of the dogmatic doomsday prophets, always seems so logical but is at the same time too simple and easy to refute. Remember that Proverb about seeming right when you first hear their case?

In 1971, the average car achieved 12 miles to the gallon. 

Today, that is 26.5. 

In 1971 the average cost of a gallon of gas was .36/gl. and minimum wage was $1.60 per hour. 

The minimum wage earner needed to work 13.5 minutes to travel 12 miles in their 1971 car. 

Today, the average cost of gas is $3.52/gl. 

and the average car travels 26.5 miles per gallon. 

At $7.25 per hour, the minimum wage earner needs to burn .4528 gallons of gas to travel 12 miles at a cost of $1.59 to our worker, which means they need to work 13.15 minutes at their job to be able to do so. Shocked?

Would you rather work 13.5 minutes at a minimum wage job for a gallon of gas or 13.15 minutes? 

Even though the price of gas per gallon has skyrocketed, when measured in hours of labor, the minimum wage worker is ahead of the game. 

Just because the price of gas has increased 977% since 1971 doesn’t mean people are poorer. That is too simple of an argument that breaks down with any sort of analytical rigor.

Now, I know this is where you think you caught me. 

“The average price of a car is WAAAY up compared to 1971. 

Even more so when measured in hours of labor.” 

While you make a great point, cars today also offer airbags, better safety engineering, more comfortable handling and ride, better brakes, better emissions for the environment, traction control, etc. Those are all signs we are wealthier, not poorer. The point is, we can do this with a lot of daily items we use. 

Milk. Coffee. Electricity. 

You will, if you try hard enough, find a few things like homes in California, that have seen the hours of labor required to obtain increase dramatically if you look hard enough. 

My only point here is to get you off the "Look at the price of XYZ" bandwagon that everyone uses. 

Make sure you don’t look at price alone. 

Does population growth or other factors come into play as part of the reason for higher prices of the product you are observing? 

Or is it forever and only because “They’re printing money!” 

My point of this exercise was to slow you down in drawing drastic conclusions about money printing being the end of all things evil because of price inflation.

Fallacy #2 – Money Printing = Massive Inflation and Leads to Hyperinflation

I know there is a lot of debate currently about transitory inflation vs. permanent inflation going on. 

I am firmly in the transitory camp. 

The evidence to me is clear, even if the Fed is changing their rhetoric and dropping the transitory verbiage. 

There is currently a major labor shortage and supply chain disruption going on from COVID. 

I have multiple businesses and have seen the labor shortages first-hand. 

Last year, for example, my 64-employee trucking company saw 25%-man-hours lost to workers taking 2 weeks off (government paid) because they were exposed to or had COVID. 

Out of all the 832 workweeks lost, we only had 3 employees test positive for COVID. 

My tiny little trucking business that moves packages for FedEx was a hiccup in the supply chain. 

But multiply that by nearly every business in America, and we have some issues. 

When people are not working, they are not producing, nor are they moving products. 

When demand is there, but supply is not, prices go higher. 

Eventually, the market will alleviate these supply constraints, and in fact, business inventories are already showing they will sooner than later:

Fed Business Inventories
Business Inventories (St. Louis Fed)

If you want a hint of where prices will go from here, 

just look at the futures market for most commodities. 

Usually, commodities trade in contango, meaning the further you go out on the delivery date timeline, the higher the prices should be. 

This is normal. If I want to buy oil 1 year from now but not take delivery, then I should pay the current price of oil, plus a bit more for someone else to store that oil for me. 

If the oil on the spot market today is $90 per barrel, oil in February 2023 should cost more. 

Oil is oil, but someone must bear the cost of storing it.

Look at the future price of oil:

Oil Futures Monthly Contracts
Oil Futures (Barchart.com)

This is called backwardation. 

This unusual phenomenon is not just limited to oil, in case you thought I was cherry-picking the data to make a point. 

The same is currently true in most of the major commodities like Corn, Wheat, Soybeans, Energy, Coffee, Cotton, Sugar, Lumber, etc. 

The bottom line is, prices should be coming down in the next few months, and this current huge spike in inflation that cost the minimum wage earner 2.7% more hours for a basket of goods, after two decades, could soften and see that workers having gotten ahead of their 2002 peer if we do soften. 

If money printing was the source of inflation, then why is the CRB Index (Commodity Basket) down 44% since the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, yet the M2 money supply has exploded over 1200%? Something isn’t adding up to the money supply = hyperinflation narrative. 

It does equate to hyperventilating though almost every day in most financial circles.

Money supply means nothing to prices unless there that money supply has velocity in an economy. 

Here is a simple example to prove my point. 

Let’s pretend the US Government gives 329.5 million American $100,000 tomorrow from the printing press. 

Everyone’s knee-jerk reaction is “hyperinflation!!!” 

We just increased the money supply by $32.95 trillion overnight.

Is that true though? What if the US government told you that you could only take the cash and put it in the mattress for the rest of your lives? 

You weren’t allowed to spend any of it. 

Would prices skyrocket just because the money supply exploded overnight? 

I would argue that it would not because the new money is not chasing goods. 

Now, what if the government told you that you had to spend the money within a week on a brand-new Cadillac Escalade 

or you must give the money back. 

If 329.5 million people run out to buy the 40,000 Escalades that are produced each year, we could expect the price of an Escalade to increase to $823,750,000 overnight. 

You see, just because we have more money does not mean we have more supply of the things we want to buy. 

In this case, the price goes up due to both money supply and velocity of money chasing a fixed amount of Escalades.

Now, what if the government said you get $100,000, but you must spend it on any new car within the next 30 years. 

At the current 12,000,000 per year annual car production rate, the current money supply increase would absorb all the car production for the next 27 years. 

Many new car businesses might start as entrepreneurs want to exchange their labor and talents for some of that money, 

thus potentially driving down the price of cars through supply increases and competition.

Am I advocating that we do that as a nation? Absolutely not. Can it be done? Yes. 

There are other consequences from doing this, but hyperinflation and monetary collapse are not one of them.

Which brings up the next fallacy:

Fallacy #3 The 'Debt' from 'Printing' Will Never Be Repaid. We Will Default.

This is an easy one to get worked up about, and many do. 

But it is easily put to rest when one understands that the money never has to be repaid. 

Ever. 

Somewhere in our brains that doesn’t sit right, because if I personally borrow money from the bank and don’t repay it with interest, I lose whatever secured that loan. 

If I borrow $100,000 and buy a car, then I need to repay $115,000 over X years or the bank takes my car. 

In this example, I had to go to the bank and ask them to lend me money. 

When it comes to our country, it just doesn’t work that way. 

The collective thinking is that we must call up China and Japan or other countries, tail between our legs, and hope they will be kind enough to lend us money for a bit longer, even though we are up to our eyeballs in ‘debt.’ 

But that is just not the way it works. The more the government runs a deficit, the more you and I run a surplus. 

I don’t know about you, but I really like it when my balance sheet is showing a surplus. Were you aware that the US Government’s deficit equals your and my surplus… to the penny? 

For whatever reason, everyone thinks it's a good thing for their government to ‘pay down the debt’ before we take on too much more, and collapse. 

Again, that is true for you and me, we can take on too much debt, or for a corporation, or even the state of California, but it is not the case for the US Government. 

If the government were to start chipping away at the ‘debt’ they would need to run a surplus and tax more than they spend. 

With the excess surplus, they could then pay down the 'debt.' 

Likewise, for you to run a surplus, you need to earn more than you spend. 

Nothing new there. 

The government surplus would need to come from your and my balance sheet though. 

If the government is taxing more than they are spending, we are paying more than we are earning when it comes to the government. 

Government surpluses are extremely bad for private sector savings. 

In fact, the last time the US ran a surplus was during the 2000–2002 timeframe. 

Do you remember how well our private sector balance sheets did during that time? 

Collectively, we were required to go to the bank and ask for loans to maintain our lifestyles (yes, we can argue for lowering our lifestyle, but that is an argument for another day)

Our balance sheets were going negative because the US Government was running a surplus. Look here:

I don’t know about you, but I really prefer that the blue line stays above zero since I land in the blue as a citizen/user of the US Currency. 

I don't get to create it, so I have to exchange my labor, goods, and services to get what the government determines is the currency. 

(Enter in all the comments how the population will supposedly lose faith in the currency and demand payment in gold, or milk, or Bitcoin, or whatever. 

That's just not how it works though. 

Taxes satisfied in the currency of the folks who can put you in jail will require you to sell your gold, milk, or Bitcoin to obtain US Dollars to pay your tax liability. 

There is a lot more to say on this topic, but that is for another article.) 

I REALLY don’t want the government to pay down the debt, and truly prefer that the debt keeps growing.

Remember that quote at the beginning of this article from 1990 when the debt was at $4 trillion? 

If you are making the same baseless claims about our inevitable collapse because of the size of the debt like they were in 1990 (and before that), then I would ask you flat out, what is the proper level of debt that we should have as a nation? 

If you are certain that it is too high at $30 trillion, then where should we get it down to? 

We know that $4 trillion in 1990, although seemingly high, was obviously not the arrow to our Achilles' heel. 

You can’t answer that question because there is no answer to it. 

You don’t know what the number should be, you just ‘feel’ like it is too high currently. 

You might even use the current inflation spike we are experiencing as proof as to why you are correct.

Many in this camp will throw out the stat that shows the debt being so large every citizen owes $90,590. 

When presented like that, it sounds overwhelming. 

"How in the world am I going to come up with $90,590 to pay my portion of the debt? 

What if my neighbors can't afford it? Will I have to cover their portion as well? Oh no! This is depressing! We are doomed!"

Until you realize the debt is not owed by you. 

If government deficits = private sector surplus as shown above, 

then that means there should be at least that much in assets per citizen, correct? 

Well, the assets per citizen are actually quite higher. 

Before you go drink away your despair about all the debt you supposedly owe for your part, 

spend some time as U.S. National Debt Clock: Real Time and focus some time on the asset side of the ledger. 

In the same way that you don't owe $90,560 of debt, you also don't get $605,820 of assets per citizen. 

The US has plenty of national assets. 

In fact, we have $34 trillion of national assets compared to $30 trillion of national debt. 

Oh yeah, on top of that, we have $166 Trillion in total household assets. 

So, with $201.2 Trillion in total national assets to cover $86.5 trillion in household and national debt, we are sitting with a Loan-to-Value of 43%. 

Can you imagine living life in a $1 million home that has a $430,000 mortgage on it, and being completely paranoid you are broke, bankrupt, and about to be ruined?

People do every day.

Debt/Assets Per Citizen
US Assets Per Citizen (www.usdebtclock.org)

There will be bumps and bruises at times like we are seeing right now with huge money supply chasing a crippled supply chain, but that will ease soon. 

The high drama and intense rhetoric of the current inflationary disaster, when put in the proper context, will be forgotten soon enough in our near future. 

The Dollar isn't going to collapse. 

The US is not burdened by so much debt that we are bankrupt. The standard of living from the past few decades has not gone down. 

Your children will not be required to pay off the debt. 

Tune out the noise that is so strong right now that everyone thinks they have this all figured out and their arguments are logical. Go enjoy your life.

Until then, be in awe as to why everything will not fall apart over the next decade. 

Lord willing, if I am still alive then, I will write another update to see if we collapsed like you might have thought we would. 

Many mocked me 10+ years ago in that article, certain I was wrong. 

Larry Burkett in 1990 was certain the collapse was imminent. 

Is 32 years not a long enough time to price your position? 

Were the last 10 years since my articles just luck and it's all about to hit the fan?

Or do you need to change your own thinking on the subject?




q and a: 

Well, My mantra personally is to live below my means, 

save and invest 10% 

and to hold no debt 

I don't care what arguments are made that delay the the consequences of a person, business or nation state that disregard these inviolable laws, 

I know that it will not stand.

The day will come, no matter the rationales or reasoning that the broken financial laws will reap what has been sown.

-->
Quite correct. Currencies in most countries that collapse have done so internally over a period of time. 

The British pound is a good example. 

Until WW I it was the commercial and financial bedrock of the world. 

Politics turned left after the war and, despite a few course corrections (Thatcher) remained so until now, 

reflecting a wishful state that violates all experience with the rules of economics. 

As for the US, take a look at our profligate congress and the buying power of the $. 

What used to be a steady march to perdition is now a race to collapse. 

The best evidence is the rise of crazy economics like the crypto that has zero intrinsic value and relies for its existence on the greater fool axiom



--->  

Confusing comments to me considering the price of the Dollar is now at 20+ year highs 

while the balance sheet of the Fed exploded, 

  and the pound is still in existence today even though it 'collapsed'


--

Hey Tim, what makes you think SP500 can reach somewhere around 5500 this cycle before a prolonged bear market takes hold?

--->

The amount of liquidity in the market. 

Rates are going up which is actually a net income transfer into the economy from the government. 

Consumers will lose income, 

but businesses and banks will gain. 

The government paying higher interest means more money into the economy.

QT is not what everyone makes it out to be #1. 

And #2, if they are worried about it, the Fed is actually STILL expanding the balance sheet. 

Inflation is about to come down in a very strong way also, imo.

Our target from last year to our clients was 5800. I have adjusted it down based on the technical aspects of Avi Gilburt's technical analysis. I won't hold on for that last 300 points we see based on our own analysis.


---

I like your take on MMT, but I'm a little confused about your reference to Robert Prechter. 

I know he questions conventional thinking and myths about the financial markets. 

However, generally speaking, his chaos theory, or fractal math, says fiat currency is a disaster waiting to happen because it's based on the government issuing debt (not based on real money). 

He's a gold guy, but what is real debt? 

Doesn't all money require faith in its value from some entity? 

It's a psychological phenomenon, as I see it.

Are you not fundamentally saying the opposite of Prechter? 

I don't know who to believe. Smart people on both sides make these broad predictions and claims. It's exasperating to know what's real.

--->

@jhholler Great question. I do not agree with Prechter assuming fiat is a disaster. 

They all like to claim that all fiat systems fail. 

Yet, when I look around the world, I only see fiat systems in existence and no gold standards. 

Is it possible to assume that all gold standards eventually fail?

Disagreeing with Prechter on the failure of fiat doesn't exclude me from agreeing with him on the fact that the exogenous events we would expect to impact the market, just aren't there.

-->
|
BUT!
Fiat systems are NOT disasters in and of themselves but BECOME disasters because they can be manipulated most easily by government (as opposed to an asset backed system)

|
--->  
@jimregina Why is that statement ridiculous when it is in fact the truth? Do you see any major countries not on a fiat system?

If they fail, it has more to do with the evil people in charge. 

The system itself is neutral as you stated.

Gold backed systems fail because they choke and limit growth, and humans want to grow and develop new things.

-->
@Tim Ayles "If they fail, it has more to do with the evil people in charge."
BINGO!!

Gold backed systems don't FAIL....they are changed or discontinued by the said "evil people in charge" because they can't debase the Fiat!

Gold keeps evil people honest....until they get enough power to distroy the system...

--> 

@jimregina That is an assumption as to the reason they are changed. 

The reality though is that gold is deserted because the system is limited to the growth it can obtain.

Imagine an economy with 10 ounces of gold in it and 10 businesses. 

In a fixed system, those 10 ounces will eventually flow to the business that provided essential services like water and food. 

If the Economy wants to add 10 businesses faster than the mining of the additional 10 ounces of gold to grow the economy, they struggle. 

The economy can only grow as fast as the money supply in that situation. 

Also, while we might think the government is evil, just have the 10 ounces of gold find their way into the hands of a select few business owners hands and see the evil in their heart come out as well. 

Human hearts, whether government or private business, is rotten. 

No matter who has the power, it will get abused. 

For some reason in this time in history, we think only the government as evil.

Also, inflation is very good for businesses and bad for consumers. 

If you flip to a gold system, you have deflationary forces on business which is bad for them and great for the consumer. 

The gold standard, although seemingly high in moral inputs, is really not healthy for a dynamic and growing economy. 

I can tell you think differently there, but again, there is a reason that gold standards don't survive, and it isn't always because of bad actors as you infer. 

The constraints on a growing economy also need to be factored.



---

I believe there is a fundamental change taking place that could cause the next 30+ years to be much different from the past. 

What we say over the last few decades was significant deflation and globalization as a result of the wall coming down, 

the result being the US was the only true super power. 

You can also throw in the incredibly positive effects of the internet.

Today we are looking at supply chain disruptions, 

a war in Europe 

and a resurgent China. 

This is causing globalization to retreat. 

As companies stop moving manufacturing to a cheaper locale, 

which happened a lot over the last few decades, 

purchasing power for one hour worked (I like this concept, BTW) is likely to fall.

While I'm sure there are going to be more technological innovations that can drive increased productivity, 

therefore increasing purchasing power for people, 

I do think the end of globalization is going to have an equally large effect. 

Not predicting a massive collapse here, but we definitely have lost decades-long tailwinds.


--->

@Daniel Carlson Great observations. 

I do agree with your conclusions on globalization going away 

and the potential negative impacts to the one hour worked concept.

The flip side to the argument it is bad is: 

One man's inflation is another man's higher income. 

Right now, my business costs might go up but I can't raise prices as my customers can go internationally and get lower prices. 

Although this is true in theory, not in the real world yet (corporate profit margins are at record highs) if the nationalistic vibe continues to strengthen,

rising prices will equal rising incomes as well. 

The worker is without leverage to ask for higher wages with the current globalization. 

If you want too much, I will get a foreign worker to do it for less. 

So prices can increase and wages can stay low. 

Globalization is great for corporations and terrible for workers. 

If we move away from that, the reverse should take place.

Inflation is really good for the business owner if it is bad for the consumer with not leverage on wages. 

I own a repair shop. If the cost of my brakes is $100 and my margin is 30%, I make a profit of $30 on a set of brakes. 

If my cost goes to $150, I now make a profit of $45 on those same brakes with consistent margins. 

While the buyer of the brakes is bummed, I am happy.

One man's inflation is another man's higher income.

-->

siamhefa

@Tim Ayles Isn't this analysis a bit short sided? 

Aren't all business owners also consumers? 

So yes, you increased your profit to 45, 

but then you need to spend extra also on all the items you need to survive other than brakes, right? 

Hoe does that factor in to things?

-->

Tim Ayles

@siamhefa Where does the money go then is the question you need to answer. 

It doesn't disappear. Just map it out on a piece of paper and you will see. The higher costs end up in someone's bank account.

A rather interesting set of propositions, 

some quite valid and some of which are simply based on 

the fallacy of logic that imputes the validity of the whole from a part. 

The most significant error is the ignoring of the effects of debt and inflation beyond the ability to pay or compensate. 

This amounts to the creation of something, monetary instruments, from an immaterial nothing, a promise to pay. 

I believe that creation of a material substance in that fashion was done some time ago and even the Creator took six days to accomplish it and seems not to have been repeated. 

It is true that Venezuela is relatively inconsequential, 

except to Venezuelans or their debtors, and can be managed by the rest of the world. 

That can not be said for the other foundational currencies of the world. 

The British pound, once worth about US $5 now quotes at $1.37 and there is little reason to believe that continued profligacy on their part would not eventually result in complete collapse. 

Finally, this sort of thing usually happens when the so-called sages say "this time it is different".

-->

Tim Ayles

@linkdonald The hard money guys are the folks who have believed in a failed system. Show me a hard money system today that exists and hasn't failed. Of course, the next one will be different?
Your most significant error is this statement:
"The most significant error is the ignoring of the effects of debt and inflation beyond the ability to pay or compensate."
I am dying to find out what those effects of debt are in your mind.

Liked and saved! Thank you for writing this! I agree on all counts!
That being said, I actually do think the gov't should stop borrowing and instead simply print what it needs (with some rule in place limited it to some percentage of GDP) because right now the interest payment money is not going to build schools or roads or to pay soldiers, but just goes out the door; and it is more inflationary (even if, I agree, is not a big deal) because people can borrow against the Treasuries, which creates even more money into the system. But overall, you are correct, the US national debt is no big deal.

@Joe S.1 Printing and borrowing are the same thing, really. They spend the money and then create the bonds for those who end up with that spent money and who want to save it. We don't borrow money first and then spend it. We did on the gold standard....but under fiat the operational aspects of the current system are quite different and many don't actually understand it, which is why they freak out over the 'debt'

@Joe S.1 When you say we....who are you referring to? The populace? Or the government?
Interest paid by the government goes to those who own the Treasuries. Where those individuals spend the money is up to them. As a country, we could do that as well as spend on more socially strong programs like infrastructure where everyone benefits, not just the Treasury investor.

What about Brazil in the late '80's? I still have some of their worthless money. They printed it like it was going out of style. There are other examples like Brazil, so I find it hard to believe categorically that the United States monetary system cannot crash. When someone says" it never can happen" it inevitably does happen. Brazil had hyperinflation, government debt, and other factors contributing to their monetary collapse. Their case may not be exactly the same as what is happening here, but there are similarities nonetheless. Never say never.

@Me Mizar First of all, do you see the silliness of the "what about Brazil 40 years ago?" The world is on a floating exchange fiat system going on 50 years. If the "it's about to blow up because of debt and printing" narrative was legit, wouldn't there be MANY countries blowing up all the time? When a country does blow up, like Argentina, or Venezuela, or Weimar, or Zimbabwe, it usually has very specific reasons as to why, and usually to do with foreign denominated debts.
You would be better off finding out why the US, Japan, UK, etc HAVEN'T blown up like Brazil or the others listed above. Therein you will find your understanding.

@Kevin Mackie Hi Kevin. Venezuela is often brought up as an example, like Zimbabwe or Weimar. I am surprised it took this long. They are not good example though. Understanding the function of the monetary system would allow one to understand why. They owed massive debts in a currency they didn't control. Same with Weimar for example. Weimar was forced to convert German currency to pay the allies as well as reparations.
Venezuela has a problem the U.S. does not, and will never have: It owed massive debts in a currency it cannot print itself, namely, U.S. dollars. When oil (its principal resource) was booming, Venezuela was able to meet its repayment schedule. But when the price of oil plummeted, the government was reduced to printing Venezuelan bolivars and selling them for U.S. dollars on international currency exchanges.

@Tim Ayles I think you overcomplicate things. Here it is at the street level. I love going out to eat. I do so for lunch every day. Before inflation started picking up, my budget would easily allow for this. Now, all the meals at all my favorite restaurants are 10% more expensive. At least. My income has not risen commensurately. The food is not 10% better. As long as inflation persists and I don't change my lifestyle, I will get poorer than I otherwise would have been, a situation that would not have arisen absent inflation. This is why inflation is often called a regressive tax on the poor. You are being overly dismissive of what inflation does, and you seem to think yourself smarter than every professional money-manager and financial coach/advisor ever, virtually all of whom are constantly warning about the corrosive effects of inflation. The data you have shared is interesting and useful and there is truth in it. But there simply isn't enough nuance in your take.

"The debt at the time he wrote that was hovering around $4 trillion. You can imagine how certain and scared everyone was at such a high level of debt. 32 years later $26 trillion more in debt, and here we still are. What gives? "
I'll tell you what I think gives.. years of Fed tinkering WILL come back to haunt us... the only thing left in their quiver is rate hikes. I did not think at my age I would see us move so far backward and in just over a year.... expanding money supply and rampant *REAL* inflation that is really 2.5 times what the economists publish. Yeah it's bad out there

@craftbrewinfo Hi craft. Data being manipulated is a thesis you have and requires us to believe you. In fact, I would argue, as Bud just says of my thesis, it's too simplistic and easy to just explain it all away by saying the data is a conspiracy.
I provided actual data to prove my point as to why things priced in hours of time prove inflation isn't what the headlines make it out to be. You only provide anecdotal evidence that things are bad out there.
In relation to rate hikes....... they will be temporary. The 10 year MIGHT go to 2.5 from the 2% it is at now. Rate hikes add to inflation as they increase the cost of all goods and services. Higher rates also increases the income paid on the huge debt levels through the interest rate channels. The problem is they take income out of the public and send income to the banks and other financial firms.
I wrote this article on the bond 10+ years ago also. Take a look at the second chart regarding the direction of rates after QE stopped. It was the complete opposite of what you though should happen when the Fed stopped buying bonds. seekingalpha.com/...
"I wrote on August 16th, 2010, in the comment section of my original article:
'My long term target unfortunately is 1% on the ten year and 2-2.5% on the 30 year. It will be a bumpy ride, but that's the target. Of course - if the details change, so might the target prices.'"
We should be asking "why" to better understand, yet everyone keeps making the same certain statements that are wrong today.

@Krek "Homelessness is EXPONENTIALLY higher. As is incarceration, compared to decades ago"
You do have a habit of spouting false facts. Incarceration has been trending down since 2008. It is much higher than MANY decades ago, but that is not what you claimed. Countless websites from a Google search will confirm this.
Homelessness is so complex that saying it is exponentially higher is pure nonsense. The stats are poor and incomplete, and nearly impossible to compare across surveys. By homelessness, do you mean living without shelter (on the streets), or do you include people living in shelters, do you include people who loose their homes/apartments and have to shelter with friends or family? Changes in homelessness tend to follow major economic disruptions, and COVID certainly did so, but the "compared to decades ago" would make this spike irrelevant.
It would be nice if you would temper your hard biases and provide reasonable links supporting your claims, but I do not expect you will ever do so.

@Tim Ayles I partially agree with your points, but not the parts about inflation. You linked to this article from your comment to my article where I showed the massive fiscal and monetary stimulus caused the inflation we have now. seekingalpha.com/...
Much of the current inflation will recede as the stimulus fades and bottlenecks get fixed. However, I believe wage inflation is here to stay (except during recessions) for demographic reasons. seekingalpha.com/... I gave 9 reasons including
1) We are already at full employment
2) Baby Boomer retirements
3) Much less immigration
4) Historic levels of corporate innovation and growth (biggest reason)
Inflation will likely significantly exceed 2% for quite some time except during recessions due to wage inflation. The excessive stimulus brought this on us much faster than it woud have happened normally.

I can not predict the future of interest rates....The Fed and Treasury have some ability to control interest rates.....Based on current demographics (the aging population) and more demand for social programs going forward, what happens if interest rates go up 1-2 percent in the next five years? Most of the government debt is currently short term Bills and Bonds- refinancing at those require more taxes and more taxes require a further drain on the economy. The US has benefited from the petro dollar with lower costs of imports (i.e. deflationary prices for consumers). As the Petro Dollar loses its strength, consumer costs could go up (i.e. inflation); an increase in interest rates would further hamstring our economy. I do not see these items addressed. Not saying they will come to pass, but, they are reasonable points that need to be addressed.

@Bud Fox, the Higher rates is not an issue for the issuer of the currency. In fact, higher rates is more income to the bond holders and actually has inflationary ramifications through the interest rate income channel. It just changes who gets the income. Like higher inflation is good for the farmer as they get more income for the same corn type of thing.

The problem with predicting monetary collapse is that the investors expect an immediate manifestation. On the other hand, the elements cited in the collapse are real and, thanks to the laws of compounding, can be self fulfilling if corrective action is not taken. When one notes the action or inaction of government, the prediction should cause concern.

Thank you. In spite of this bout of price inflation, the primary trend is deflation, which is driven by secular trends of declining demographics and increasing productivity from technological innovation. Once the Covid thing is completely in the rear view mirror, soon, supply issues will ameliorate and excess demand will abate and price trends will normalize. The Fed will be in a position to pivot on rates and balance sheet, or drag it out over a much longer trajectory.

As long as you keep the series constant the data will reflect a pattern of more man hours with of course the exception after this latest recession which btw is constant for all recoveries but for a short period.

jinkies, those are some elaborate mental gymnastics. you're overlooking the most important/critical part of this: the human element. the dollar's value is based entirely on confidence/coercion. once that's lost, usa will collapse just like soviet union. people are emotional, they don't base their decisions on the arguments you're putting forth.
just look at class warfare in usa. americans have a ridiculously overinflated material standard of living. they comprise a bit over 4% of the earth's population, yet consume nearly 1/3rd of the planet's resources. the so-called "poor" are not angry because they are hungry, they're upset because elon musk has more toys. like incest, it's all relative.
regarding the astronomical debt level, blame bretton woods, a terrorist/tyrannical government, decades of exporting inflation with no real consequences, and trading on the legacy of a few decades of pseudo "greatness" whilst europe was destroyed/rebuilding post-ww2. at least other nations usually have infrastructure to show for it (healthcare system, universities, public transport, childcare, high speed rail, housing, etc.)
eventually, the rest of the planet looks at america and says: no thanks. an unpredictable, degenerate, completely mad country. where medical mistakes are the third leading cause of death, there are more guns than people, basic societal problems remain unresolved, half the country is anti-science, most of them believe in an imaginary god, etc. (and everyone's brainwashed to north korean levels, insist they live in a "developed country", and the rest of us should emulate them).
the place looks increasingly unstable from an outsider's perspective, an unsafe place to keep capital long-term.
that is what will bring you down. perception becomes reality. demoralisation of the populace, and nobody wanting to take the dollar. usa bought some time by eliminating gaddafi, hussein, and everyone else who proposed alternative systems, but that's not going to work with china/russia. now with uk out of europe, you have no friends left here. macron, maas, juncker, and countless others openly insist we stop using your currency. not just for our sovereignty, but to bypass bogus sanctions.
when the ride stops? of course, nobody knows. the real question is: will it be a whimper, or a bang?

Yankee $ as the reserve currency of the world is waning. The percentage of payments in the dollar versus other currencies as world trade is also waning for the former. The US as a percentage of world GDP is waning. US as empire is also waning. The SWIFT exchange will soon have a competitor. Our so-called allies are hedging their US bet. The US military has not accomplished it goals in a major conflict since the Korean War.
Empire is largely the reason why yankee dollar is the reserve currency. The world is no longer a unipolar power construct. Regional hard & soft powers compete with the US on the world stage. Africa is up for grabs. The US is losing influence in the Americas, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.
The US main exports are commodities. A viable superpower is not an importer of manufactured goods. A debtor nation cannot long survive in the arc of human history without a manufacturing base. The US has a 3rd world economy since commodities are what the world wants in great quantities from them.
Empires like bankruptcy starts slowly then collapses suddenly. Empires fall due to political, social and/or economic reasons. Prima facia in Western history that the US is modeled on are Athens, Roman, and England.
The US as a democratic - republic is moribund. Before empires collapse they perform the same atrocities upon its citizens as it did to its “colonists”. Prima facia is the militarization of US police forces.
Once the dollar loses its hegemony the false narrative the author suggests of the nation’s assets - liabilities = wealth will vanish in a twinkling.

@TDune75 Technology is not the number 1 export. Please review 2021 census bureau list of exports.
www.census.gov/...
Please recognize that commodities are indeed numero uno. Oil as a single commodity is larger than all technology. If you disagree with this arithmetic fact as outdated please let me know what supplanted 1 + 1 = 2.
The West has been the top dog since the 19th Century. It has humiliated, colonized, conquered, subjugated most of the rest of the world by plunder, or robbing/buying at preferred pricing or risk the consequences of not exporting their natural resources and in return the “colonies” buy value added goods in unbalanced trade. England was the poster child until Bretton Woods. The US by the 1950s cemented the transfer of power after the Suez Canal debacle for France & England.
The US since its founding has also been a colonizing power, I.e., Manifest Destiny, Mexican - American War, Spanish -American War, invasion or proxy invasions in Central & South America & the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, & Africa.
The Pax Americana prevented the UK from suffering the fate as other empires throughout recorded history. What nation given the US track record on the American, Asian, European continents will provide their umbrella of protection? The US certainly will certainly incur much worst than just Suez or the 60s devaluation of the sterling.
The below link is only a taste of what will come.
www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/...
The US response in the 60s after forcing the UK to devalue was to bail the UK out via FDI. The subsequent fallout was surrendering an independent UK foreign policy to the whims of US foreign policy.
If you call subjugation of your foreign policy and begging for FDI as doing just fine plus being considered the 51st state your lexicon is not the English language I am familiar with. Moreover, I doubt US creditors without the US military strength to backup its bluster will tolerate default without exacting a pound of flesh closest to the heart. And if they do for some odd reason the social safety net will collapse making the Great Depression poverty rate look like the boom times. Foreigners will then buy devalued assets priced in dollars for cents on the dollar.

Even for the boy who falsely cried wolf, it was actually lurking in the background and eventually showed up :) Here, there is no false cry. The math is there to back it up.
Bitcoin at $40K, run down houses selling at $500K, countries trying to dethrone the dollar, the SWIFT facility and so on. It will happen (but no one can pin point the exact time frame). Remember the chanting, "Sun never sets on the British Empire"? Just the human nature alone guarantees the collapse.

@ECE_Prof IMO, anything that dethrones the dollar has nothing to do with the amount of them or the fiat framework. The reason people and nations are moving away from SWIFT and the dollar is that the US Government and other tyrannical leaders have weaponized the dollar. It is the reason Russia is looking for an alternative. As well as Freedom Truckers. Anytime you or another nation doesn't fall in line with the colonialists, they use the Dollar system to force you in line.
That is also another topic for another article. This article was just to focus on the hyperventilating certainties that haven't happened for 32 years so far (actually 51 since 1971)....... but I'll keep waiting, I guess.
In the meantime..... I look around and see how only hard money systems have failed and don't exist today. All the failing fiat systems are alive at the moment.

@Tim Ayles Thanks. Your first para was enlightening to read (that impartial assessment) but it is inevitable (that is the human factor I am thinking of and worried about).
" I look around and see how only hard money systems have failed " - Is it a sarcasm, I am not sure. Well, empires have disappeared starting from Indian, Roman, Ottoman etc. Gold survived but even that is fighting for life under one nation control.
Few days ago, I refreshed my mind about " "The Dark Lives of Klaus Fuchs, Nancy Thorndike Greenspan concluded that "Fuchs sought 'the betterment of mankind' [when sharing secrets with the Soviets] ... because "his goal became to balance world power and to prevent nuclear blackmail" according to a New York Times review by the conservative historian Ronald Radosh. "
Whatever he thought (balance world power or not), that was in a way a great thinking. I can't imagine what one super power alone (in the control of billionaires or one group, whatever) would have done to the rest of the world without that balancing force. Afterall, we (human beings) are part divine, part animal (may be I am wrong in the sense animals are better than us!) or beast and one dominates the other at times. We bitched about USSR putting missiles in Cuba, but think taking out Iran, Iraq leaders are fine or adding Ukraine to NATO should be acceptable to Russia.

So, here's my question, why do you, as well as clearly the entire FOMC, believe that supply bottlenecks will ease soon? Or perhaps, can you define soon? Many companies are very happy to continue to sell what they currently produce at higher prices and reap the benefits without the risk of increasing investment ahead of a potential slowing economy. Given the psychological aspect of inflation is clearly taking root, consumers bitch about higher prices, but pay them willingly. The consolidation of so many industries resulting in oligopolies as led us to a point where the idea of an upstart forcing the current members to change their strategy is becoming less and less viable across more and more industries. The moats are wide and deep, and whether it is food processors, tech companies or manufacturers, they have so far shown limited interest to expand productive capacity. Why will that change based on your theories?

@fxpoet I actually agree with what you are saying, and would argue the problems in the country are not the monetary system, as everyone assumes, but instead is the current crony capitalism we are living under. More and more powerful elites curve the system to their favor, at the consequence of the normal folks. Corporate profit margins are at record highs, and 60% of price increases are going to those profit margins. This article isn't about what you are talking about, but is certainly worthy of its own article.

@Plumber59 How one knows you didn't read the whole article without telling us how you didn't read the whole article. This "drive-by gotcha proof' was addressed in the article.

A fascinating read. I remember reading your similar article ten years ago. I’m not an economist but I’ve always enjoyed being an amateur study of the field. Regarding the politics of the day relating to our current economic system, I always say “take the world as it is…. Not as you feel it should be”. Like it or not, this is our system and it’s still chugging along. You make some valid points. I suppose at some point in the future there will be some form of monetary modification (when the dollar becomes worth so little in relative terms that it will need to be exchanged for a newer unit of exchange of more manageable size… not trillions and quadrillions). What would that look like? Probably an orderly deal I imagine. I think the lesson is to invest your long term capital into the real economy instead of hoarding cash as a perceived store of value, which it isn’t. Thanks for an interesting read. ‘Very thought provoking.

I'm seeing a lot of articles by people who directly or indirectly run other peoples money, making a case to keep our heads. To a certain extent I can agree. The howls about debt and our imminent collapse never end. Remember Peter Schiff.
Yet ,keeping it simple..debt, over spending etc. is not a problem until it is.
Or we can just delete debt by MMT.
It appears that we are nearing a point where answers about debt concern may be nearing a resolution. Mr market decides.

@terryongarland Sounds like you are in the "just wait" camp.
I've been waiting a loooooooong time. Japan has twice the GDP-Debt level we do, and they have struggled with deflation for decades. We have a long way to go to catch up to them.

@Tim , Japan is unique in that the Japanese save a higher proportion of their income, and then keep a higher proportion of that savings in their banks. But all bank-held savings are frozen. Bank-held savings have a zero payments velocity. Banks don't lend deposits. Deposits are the result of lending. That's why income velocity in Japan is .55 and in the U.S. it is 1.12.
“Japanese households have 52% of their money in currency & deposits, vs 35% for people in the Eurozone and 14% for the US.”
Japan’s deposit rate is -.13 (average rate paid by commercial banks to individuals or corporations on deposits). Japan’s benchmark rate is minus .10.
POMO's, LSAP's, QE's, money multiplier depends on the ratio of the trading desk's bank to nonbank purchases. That ratio is higher in Japan allowing for more sterilization (less money created). Therefore, Japan is able to monetize more debt (largely because of negative real rates of interest).

@Salmo trutta Due to decades long bear market, the Japanese choose to put their savings in the banks, .vs the US where most put it in productive assets like stocks and bonds etc. I think 30% of Japanese own stocks whereas 56% of Americans?
I fully understand that the banks do not lend deposits. Not sure of your point there.
The US, like Japan, can monetize debt and the personal savings rates of the populace is really not a causal effect for that. Being the sovereign issuer of the currency is.

Great article. Love the next level thinking about these economic fear topics. Should also be added that last I checked the Fed. now owns approximately 1/3 of the debt. The interest paid on that portion goes back to the treasury. I do think we should be concerned about growing deficits which run the risk of increasing the money supply to the point of causing a sustaining inflationary cycle. Perhaps more concerning are effective 0% interest rates along with perpetual QE from the Federal Reserve. Price inflation is annoying, but asset price inflation sows the seeds for crisis as we have seen happen repeatedly from the Dot com market crash (early 00's) and the financial crisis.(2008)

Dr. Franz Pick:
(1)"government bonds are certificates of guaranteed confiscation."
(2)“The fact is that the destiny of every currency is devaluation and expropriation.”
(3)“The difficulty with a debt that doubles every ten years is that the interest compounds to the point that it can no longer be paid out of the current revenues. Once the interest itself is debt financed, the compounding accelerates."
That's why folks subscribed to Dr. Franz Picks’ “Pick's Currency Report”, a monthly newsletter, and “Pick's Currency Yearbook” (90 currencies each year).

@Tim Ayles Default is inevitable, in some form or another. Either entitlements will be cut, or another currency reissued.
All the economies in the world are being run in reverse. Interest is the price of loan funds, the price of money is the reciprocal of the price level.
We are not yet like Japan, with income velocity @ 0.55x. "That means that each additional 100 Japanese yen in circulation produce only 55 yen of additional GDP."
Powell thinks savings are money. M2 is mud pie. All bank-held savings are frozen, lost to both consumption and investment, indeed to any type of payment or expenditure. Banks don't lend deposits, deposits are the result of lending.
Japan’s deposit rate is -.13 (average rate paid by commercial banks to individuals or corporations on deposits). Japan’s benchmark rate is minus .10.
The Japanese save a greater proportion of their income and keep a larger proportion in their payment’s system. “Japanese households have 52% of their money in currency & deposits, vs 35% for people in the Eurozone and 14% for the US.”
See: Feb 14, 2022 · BOJ makes unlimited bond purchases to limit rates
The U.S. income velocity is 1.120. That means a new U.S. dollar produces c. 1 dollar of gDp. But in the U.S., FDIC insurance is set @ $250,000 per account.

@Salmo trutta good points. Lyn Alden Schwartzer published an article here a couple of weeks ago, predicting that the effective default mode that we are entering into is for the inflation rate to stay higher than treasury bond rates, so that The national debt is Diminished in real terms.
Hence the fed delaying and delaying to act against inflation. This is monetizing the federal debt at the expense of savers who want safe assets.
Another factor here is that the Fed remits 90% of its income, I think, back to US treasury. So whatever interest the government pays on bonds held by the Fed Are nearly all returned right back to the government.

Thanks for writing this article. I have been arguing similar points with a friend. I guess some tend to focus on negative aspects of change without factoring the positives. Grateful you see the positives!

Oh Man, I got this one!
I read that book as it was given to me by someone. It was popular among certain groups in the 90's. I sold a poorly structured investment plan and put the proceeds towards converting a 30 year mortgage into a 15 year. I still think that was a good move as I continued to save and invest since that time.
I became Agbug here in 2010 as I was heavily into silver speculation as a response to the chaos of the GFC. I realized the luck I had fallen into and sold much of it. It was never meant to be used for "food and fuel" when the world ended. I've always thought whiskey would be the best for that, but inventory shrinkage is a constant issue.
Without anymore boring anecdotes, I like to remind my Wife "Every prediction of the end of the world has been wrong so far." Let's all try to keep our heads up and the sun in our faces as best we can.

Everybody, relax!
No country in history has had their currency wiped out through hyperinflation because their cars got better airbags!
Sir, your hypothesis is correct until it is very incorrect.
"Eventually all major Nation State Empires go down and their people lose confidence in their leaders and, in tandem, the money they issue. It has happened in Ancient Babylon, in Egypt, China, Rome, various leading nation states in Europe, and it will eventually hit the U.S. when the American people decide that they would rather live their lives as a free people rather than as slaves to a unpayable national debt whose interest will eventually consume more of the federal budget than military expenditures." — Joseph Holleman

@Catduck I always love a similar argument...... "Fiat currencies always fail!" Then the follow up list of 'whataboutism" examples.
Isn't it odd that the entire world is on a Fiat system today, and there is not one hard money system that exists?
By default.....can't I argue that all hard money systems fail since none exist today?

@Tim Ayles I'm not arguing that a hard money system is preferable, I'm just saying that a government injecting a massive amount of money into the system has potentially catastrophic consequences, based on history.

This argument has two fallacies at least
1. If does not address the ONE OF THE PURPOSE OF MONEY is “store of value” and how his argument pushes people further out on the risk scale in an attempt to maintain their living standard in the future, and all the sundry problems that come with that.
2. U.S. Government already defaulted A "SOFT" DEFAULT, via inflation and financial repression

@Aristotle Copernicus We are an ownership society system. Just because some old dead guys say money is a store of value doesn't mean that is what it should be. Store of value is better as a productive business or other investment. Money in a mattress benefits the owner. Money in producing assets betters society. You are making an ideological statement, not one that should be written in stone for everyone.
Rather than bring up new arguments, you should write your own article refuting my point, and I will be happy to respond to your points. In the meantime, I would guess you would have trouble disproving the points in the article above.

You seem to be trying to justify the concept of a free lunch or zero point energy or other quack theories. The laws of thermodynamics require great proof to be proven false. Likewise you will require great proof that the outlet of consequences for what you write are zero or trivial. It may not show in the dollar it may show for example in mass control over a person's life. capital controls. there are many outlets for the dysfunction.

@scorpionblue Thank you for reading. I disagree with your comment. I don't think I am trying to justify anything you are saying. I just laid out the case for why hyperventilating about these things isn't what one should be doing. You seem to think I should be, as maybe you do? Your comment also suggest you are certain there will be great consequences for what is happening, yet provide no date as to when or what it looks like. You are the opinion I had in mind when I wrote this article 10 years ago.

I would say the main consequences are already here and exemplified in a dysfunctional society such as high suicide rates, depression, even more control over one's freedoms, mass protests, more violence, rules, regs, taxes. slowly quality of life and gdp per capita will be some more visible consequences and we already see that. wages for workers have stagnated for decades

@scorpionblue If you really want to see dysfunctional societies, try visiting or living in countries like Pakistan, Libya, most of Central & S.America, virtually all of Africa. Then you’ll realize the USA is a pretty good country to live in, comparatively speaking. Yes, there are better (most of Europe), but even EU countries have their issues. USA will survive many decades (centuries?) into the future.

Thank you for teh article. I have come around to this way of thinking as well. After reading some Warren Mosler papers etc. I just not a fan of the MMT crowd since they tend to be in favor of high taxes and spending. Like you I am not worried about teh debt or deficits but that doesn't mean I want taxes to go up etc. Thank you.
